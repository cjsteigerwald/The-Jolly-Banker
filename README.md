University of Washington CSS 342
Completed 12/3/2014

<strong><b>Purpose</strong></b>
<p>This lab will serve a few purposes. First, it will provide hands-on experience using both queues
and binary search trees. It will also provide an opportunity for further program/class design as
the project does not specifically delineate class structure or design. A peer design review will
be required.</p><br><br>

<strong><b>Problem Overview:</strong></b><br><br>

You will build a banking application which processes transactions. This banking
application consists of three phases:
<UL>
<LI>The program will read in a string of transactions from a file into an in-memory queue.
These transactions can open accounts, withdraw funds, deposit funds, transfer funds, or ask for
the transactional history to be printed.

<LI>The program will next read from the queue and process the transactions in order.

<LI>When the queue has been depleted the program will print out all open accounts and
balances in those accounts.

</UL>
